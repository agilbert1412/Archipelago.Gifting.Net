# Gifting API

## Overview

The Archipelago Gifting API is a system built using the DataStorage. It allows Archipelago players to send gifts to each other, across games.
A gift can be any item from any game, but client mods should take care to not allow gifting items that cannot be obtained again, to avoid a player getting softlocked.

Gifts will commonly be consumable or other quality of life items that a player doing well can send to help a player that is struggling.

## Cross Game Gifting

When a gift is sent between two players playing the same game, it can usually be taken as-is. But when a gift is sent cross-game, it is not always possible to establish a fair, 1-to-1 relationship between items from different games.

For this case, gifts also include a list of **traits**. A trait is a simple text-based flag for the gift describing one of its properties. If a sender game establishes a proper set of traits for a given gift, then a completely different game can parse these traits and interpret the gift as faithfully as possible in their own environment.

For example, a coffee item could have the trait "Speed". The concept of a speed boost is much more generic, and frequently encountered, than the concept of a coffee, so a larger set of games will be able to understand a coffee gift. A game that has espresso might convert it to that, while a game that has no coffee-adjacent items could simply give the player a temporary speed boost.

## Giftbox

A GiftBox is a DataStorage entry registered to a specific player. It signals the desire and ability to receive gifts for that slot.

The key for a GiftBox is formatted as `GiftBox;[teamNumber];[slotName]`. So for player 3 on team 1, their GiftBox key would be "GiftBox;1;3". A giftbox also has metadata that is registered in the "Motherbox" for the team, describing the state of the giftbox, what kind of gifts it can accept, who owns it, etc.
The Motherbox can be accessed in Data storage at the key "GiftBoxes;[teamNumber]"

Both the Motherbox and individual giftboxes are dictionaries. The motherbox contains player slot numbers as keys, and giftbox metadata as values. A giftbox has the gift's Ids as keys, and gifts as values.

## Object Specifications

These specifications are **Data Version 2**. Previous versions are available in the git history of this file, but clients should try to stay up to date, as cross-version gifting takes a lot of extra work that most clients will not do.

### Gifts

The Factorio player sent copper plates to the Stardew Valley player to help them with a tool upgrade.

The Factorio player sent iron plates to the Witness player, but the gift was refunded as The Witness had no good way to process Iron Plates.

The Stardew Valley player sent coffee to the Witness player to give them a speed boost.

## Gift Traits

A gift trait can be any string, and as long as it is recognized by the target game, it can be processed however they would like.

For the sake of consistency and ease of use however, it is recommend to use single words that describe a concept in a very generic, vague manner.
The preferred method of describing a gift in details is to add many vague traits, instead of few specific traits. This will allow other games to also limit the number of different traits they need to understand in order to parse gifts.

Here is a list of "common" Gift traits. Everything on this list is a suggestion, and there are no strict rules as to how to attribute or process gift traits. Common sense and good faith are expected.

| Trait             | Description                                                                          |
